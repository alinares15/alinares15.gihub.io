        <h1>Who is Ashley Linares?</h1>
        <h3>An <em>Adventous Scholar</em>? Tour Guide? Explorer? On some occasions. 
        I'm a young woman from Venezuela.
        I enjoy trying new things. Coding happened to be one. Now, pursuing
        a future that will some day end the gender gap with woman in technolgy 
        feilds. A future in tech.</h3>
